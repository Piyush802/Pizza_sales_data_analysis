### Overview

This Pizza Sales Analysis project demonstrates proficiency in using SQL to analyze and visualize data effectively, to uncover actionable insights into sales trends and product performance for a pizza restaurant.
The Pizza Sales Project is a data analysis and visualization project aimed at analyzing and visualizing sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain. This project utilizes SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for data visualization. The goal of this project is to provide insights and actionable information to help the pizza restaurant chain optimize its operations, improve sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.


### Project Components
1. Data Acquisition
The project begins with the acquisition of raw sales data. This data may include information such as customer orders, product details, order dates, and transaction amounts. Data can be obtained from various sources, including databases, CSV files, or other data storage systems.

2. Data Transformation with SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This may involve tasks such as joining tables, aggregating data, handling missing values, and creating new calculated fields.

3. Data Analysis
Once the data is prepared, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis. This may include:

Identifying top-selling pizza flavors.
Analyzing sales trends over time.
Evaluating customer demographics and preferences.
Calculating average order values.
Assessing the performance of individual restaurant locations.

### SQL Queries:

• Extract and aggregate sales data from the pizza sales dataset to calculate key metrics such as total sales revenue, average order value, Total Orders.
• Analyze sales trends over time (hourly, daily, monthly) to identify peak sales periods and seasonal variations.
• Calculate sales performance metrics for individual products, including best-selling pizzas, popular pizza sizes, and revenue contribution by product category.
